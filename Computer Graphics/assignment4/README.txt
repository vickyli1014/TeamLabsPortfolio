1) Compiled on macos using cmake

2) Did not collaborate with anyone

3) Did not look at any references other than lecture notes and assignment file

4) None that I am aware of

5) Did not do any of the extra credit

6) I think I learned from this assignment! It was just a little frustrating trying to debug my code not knowing that the assignment doesn't really use the same perspective as the formuals in the lecture notes
