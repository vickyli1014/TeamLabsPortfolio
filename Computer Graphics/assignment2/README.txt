1) I compiled using macos

2) Collaborated with Peihua Huang, high level approach to rotations. Melanie Lin, high level approach to normals and positions.

3) Did not refer to anything outside of class material

4) I don't think there should be any problems.

5) Did not do any of the extra credit

6) I think the pset was very straightforward but it took me 3 days to debug a problem :((( This assignment made it more clear to me what B and T mean conceptually. It was also really interesting to learn about how to compute the normals at a point in a mesh!
