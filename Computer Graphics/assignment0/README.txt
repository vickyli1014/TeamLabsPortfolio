I compiled my code using cmake and make. I initially tried to run the starter code through Finder but got an error that said it quit unexpectedly. I ended up running the code from Terminal.

I did not collaborate with anyone. 

The references listed in the assignment were very helpful.

There were some problems that ended up being typos that the compiler did not catch.

I did not do the extra credit.

I think the assignment was cool in that I got to see the changes to the teapot as I was changing the code. However, this may be due to how I am not very experienced in C++ but I felt quite lost throughout the assignment. There were a lot of things I did not understand and were not explained in the assignment, so it was kind of difficult for me to understand different parts of the code and how to implement some things in code. I think it would also be helpful if there were more explanations about conceptually what we are doing as we make more changes and additions.
