1) I compile using cmake and make and run it through my terminal. I use Ventura 13.4

2) I did not collaborate with anyone.

3) I did not use any references outside of the assignment and lecture notes, and the glm API.

4) I had a problem where I had extra patching, but was suggested that the problem lies in my indexing.

5) I did not do any of the extra credit.

6) I learned from this assignment. However I realized I didn't use much of the skeleton in the way it was probably designed to be used. I feel like this assignment was a little overwhelming and took quite an amount of time before I had an idea of what I should do.
